Abstract Idea (to be updated) Track : FinTech Helping small community (generally lower middle class,housewives) to get loans from their
community(Society,market group, freind Circle) and person offering money can earn interest without any formalities.The loans are not 
provided by any individual or bank but the whole community contribute according to their capacity and will earn interest accordingly.
Example:- Suppose their is a community of 100 people created by some head(a popular person willing to earn more money and will be the lead
decision taker of the group)
Suppose in any month all members contributed according to their capacity and fund collected was 1 lakh then an online auction will
run and those willing to get loans can auction for interest rate. Loan will be provided to one paying more interest.The interest amount
so collected will be distributed among all members of group. The members earn money by lending money. The whole process will have a
cycle and at end of cycle each person will get their principal amount and they will get monthly distributed interest.
Here the head will be the person managing the group so one willing to join a group need to send proporsal to head and head will be
the judging authority. He will set Min/Max amount of Monthly Contribution of users .To manage all this this head will get some more 
amount than other members.
Problem Solved: Getting Loan from Banks and money lenders is always a problem for middle class people. Herein he can send a proporsal in the community that i neeed money for some XYZ reason and can get loan contributed by all members of group. Group members will be willing to help as they are getting interest every month and will get the pricipal amount at end.This is a best way for them to invest savings. We are going to build an android app facilitating the process
